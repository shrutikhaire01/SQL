In June 1970, Dr. E. F. Codd published a paper that introduced the concept of relational databases, 
which became the foundation for modern database systems. IBM developed a language called SEQUEL (later renamed SQL)
to work with these databases. In 1979, a company called Relational Software, Inc. (now known as Oracle) released the 
first commercial version of SQL. Today, SQL is widely used as the standard language for managing and interacting with 
relational databases.
